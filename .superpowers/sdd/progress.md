# Subagent-Driven Development Progress

Task 1: complete (commits c1fbdd2..edaf960, review clean; minor note: add explicit non-mutation assertion in a later metadata test pass)
Task 2: complete (commits edaf960..4c6fc71, independent review clean after Important exclusion-list fix)
Task 3: complete (commits 4c6fc71..c73c121, independent review clean after two Important and one Minor fixes)
Task 4: complete (commits c73c121..cb5ac6b, GPT-6 Sol Medium review clean; minor follow-up: externally sourced metadata must be validated before exposing indexing API)
Task 5: complete (52 knowledge tests and 4 ingestion/retrieval regressions pass; GPT-6 Sol Medium validation review approved; no source changes)

## Task 15: Fixed mini-corpus golden experiment

Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-03-local-mini-corpus-experiment-design.md` (commit `0d4656d6`, delta clarified in `858ee602`)
Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-03-mini-corpus-golden-experiment.md` (commit `858ee602`)
Workflow: each numbered plan task is implemented by GPT-6 Luna Max using TDD, then reviewed by GPT-6 Sol Medium before the next task starts.
Task 1: complete (commits `2e2bf9e1` and `ca2f77b6`; GPT-6 Sol Medium review approved; 5 focused tests pass; full suite 284 passed, 20 skipped; report: `.superpowers/sdd/local-mini-corpus-task-1-report.md`)
Task 2: complete (commits `25d5eadc`, `d4ec0f82`, `27082984`, and `81bdb575`; GPT-6 Sol Medium re-review approved after two Important code fixes; 9 focused tests pass; report: `.superpowers/sdd/local-mini-corpus-task-2-report.md`)
Task 3: complete (commit `2326e634`; GPT-6 Sol Medium re-review approved after fixing an unchecked source relation and making nested judgments immutable; 66 focused tests pass; report: `.superpowers/sdd/local-mini-corpus-task-3-report.md`)
Task 4: complete (commit `226d5f06`; GPT-6 Sol Medium review approved; 19 focused tests pass, 85 combined Task 3/4 tests pass; report: `.superpowers/sdd/local-mini-corpus-task-4-report.md`)
Task 5: complete (commit `53e982ec`; GPT-6 Sol Medium re-review approved after two Important fixes; 24 focused tests pass; no models/corpus/metrics; report: `.superpowers/sdd/local-mini-corpus-task-5-report.md`)
Task 6: complete (commit `1a7b9d5a`; GPT-6 Sol Medium approved; 17 focused tests pass; combined six-module suite 135 passed, 6 warnings; report: `.superpowers/sdd/local-mini-corpus-task-6-report.md`)
Task 7: complete (GPT-6 Sol Medium CLI re-review approved; 32 focused CLI tests and 167 combined synthetic local-evaluation tests pass; 6 warnings; Ruff/Black/diff checks pass. Real-source candidate remains in Git-ignored `local/draft/v1`: 22 documents/paths, 306 units, 473 chunks, 26 queries, 36 relevant pairs, 44 anchors; independent Sol Medium package review Ready (0 C/I/M), schema/hash/scope/anchor/privacy checks pass. Candidate status is draft; explicit user approval is still required before freeze, model download/load, or retrieval metrics, none of which has occurred. Report: `.superpowers/sdd/local-mini-corpus-task-7-report.md`)

## Task 16: Expand the local golden question set to v2
Spec: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-04-expand-local-golden-questions-v2.md` (user approved 80 total questions: immutable 26-question v1 + 54 additions).
Workflow: Luna Max TDD implementation, followed by Sol Medium diff review; source-derived authoring remains root-local under the Git-ignored `local/draft/v2/`.
Task 1: implementation commits `3077e37e`, `72c7d119`, `75d91c9b`; GPT-6 Sol Medium final review Ready with 0 C/I/M; focused synthetic suite 29 passed. The final fixes validate approved-v1 parent metadata and malformed taxonomy values, prevent same-directory/directory-alias overwrites, and atomically replace temporary files so output symlink/hardlink aliases cannot mutate v1.
Task 2: complete. Root authored 54 additions and 26 legacy metadata rows locally; quotas are 16 direct, 14 procedure, 12 comparison, 8 exception/scope, 4 multi-hop; 16 additions use multiple sources; 73 relevant source pairs have 95 anchors. One of 22 sources has no new relevant judgment under the documented answerability exception; existing v1 coverage remains unchanged. Local answerability/scope/ambiguity/near-duplicate/anchor audit complete. Builder validation reports 22 documents / 80 questions / 54 additions; synthetic suite 29 passed. GPT-6 Sol Medium metadata-only review Ready with 0 C/I/M; source-content grounding remained root-local.
Task 3: review package prepared at Git-ignored `libs/kotaemon/tests/fixtures/knowledge_eval/local/draft/v2/REVIEW.md`; it lists all 54 questions and source/page/unit locators without raw evidence spans. The user approved the 80-question set on 2026-10-04.
Task 4: complete. Two freeze integration gaps were fixed with Luna Max TDD and Sol Medium reviews: safe `source_root` propagation (37 candidate tests pass) and strict frozen-manifest construction (3 freeze tests pass; broader local CLI suite 32 passed, 1 protected-fixture test deselected). Candidate validation passed at 22 documents / 80 queries / 54 additions; only its manifest changed when rebuilt. v2 froze and independently loaded with 139 anchors. The offline four-arm run completed; all 322 artifact-manifest size/hash entries verified. Aggregate metrics and limitations are recorded in `docs/superpowers/reports/local-knowledge-eval-v2.md`; source data and per-query artifacts remain ignored.

## Task 17: Local Golden Snapshot QA Playground
Spec: `docs/superpowers/specs/2026-10-04-local-qa-playground-design.md` (user-approved).
Plan: `docs/superpowers/plans/2026-10-04-local-qa-playground.md` (commit `0aefe132`; GPT-6 Sol Medium plan review READY).
Workflow: each plan task is implemented by GPT-6 Luna Max with TDD, then reviewed by GPT-6 Sol Medium before the next task starts.
Task 1: complete (implementation `dfe7713f`; GPT-6 Sol Medium spec/quality review approved with 0 C/I/M; 13 focused tests pass; report `.superpowers/sdd/local-qa-task-1-report.md`). A contradictory rank example in the plan was corrected to match the first-five-source projection contract.
Task 2: complete (implementation `89aa5546`; GPT-6 Sol Medium spec/quality review approved with 0 C/I; 24 focused loopback tests pass; report `.superpowers/sdd/local-qa-task-2-report.md`). Minor for final review: `test_local_qa_ollama.py` uses a synthetic answer `[1]` for a shown card with `source_rank=2`; prompt mapping itself is asserted.
Task 3: complete (implementation `7ce6362d`; GPT-6 Sol Medium spec/quality review approved with 0 C/I/M; 45 focused tests pass; 49 retrieval regressions pass with 1 deselected; Black/diff checks pass; synthetic browser Ask/Clear smoke passed; report `.superpowers/sdd/local-qa-task-3-report.md`).
