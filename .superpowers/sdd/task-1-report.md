# Task 1: Canonical Knowledge Metadata — Implementation Report

## Result

Implemented the canonical knowledge metadata schema and normalizer without changing `Document`. The normalizer copies document metadata, applies overrides, derives the canonical fields, and returns a separate dictionary. Source types are `markdown`, `pdf`, `faq`, `ppt`, `excel`, `code`, `wiki`, and `other`.

## TDD evidence

**RED command:**

```text
uv run pytest libs/kotaemon/tests/test_knowledge_metadata.py -q
```

**RED output:** collection failed as expected because the package did not exist:

```text
ImportError while importing test module ...
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'kotaemon.indices.knowledge'
1 error in 4.94s
```

**GREEN command:**

```text
uv run pytest libs/kotaemon/tests/test_knowledge_metadata.py -q
```

**GREEN output:** all nine collected cases passed:

```text
9 passed in 5.53s
```

Ran `uv run black libs/kotaemon/kotaemon/indices/knowledge libs/kotaemon/tests/test_knowledge_metadata.py` (formatted two files) and `git diff --check` successfully before commit.

## Changed files

- `libs/kotaemon/kotaemon/indices/knowledge/__init__.py`
- `libs/kotaemon/kotaemon/indices/knowledge/schema.py`
- `libs/kotaemon/kotaemon/indices/knowledge/metadata.py`
- `libs/kotaemon/tests/test_knowledge_metadata.py`

## Self-review findings

- File-extension inference follows the brief's mapping, and explicit supported types (including `wiki`) take precedence.
- Logical paths use POSIX segment handling only; parent segments are collapsed and absolute upload paths are not used as defaults when a file name exists.
- Metadata is copied and caller overrides are applied to the copy. The normalizer does not modify the `Document`.
- Identifier precedence follows the brief. Source relationships supply document/parent identifiers when earlier values are absent; `chunk_id` is always the input `Document.doc_id`.
- Original metadata fields, `Document.source`, page aliases, section path, and entity fallback are covered by the focused tests.

## Concerns

No blocking concerns. The brief did not provide an enumerated list for the eight source types in prose; the implementation used the eight values implied by its explicit examples and extension table (`markdown`, `pdf`, `faq`, `ppt`, `excel`, `code`, `wiki`, `other`).
